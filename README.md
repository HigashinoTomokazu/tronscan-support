# TRON Support Center

> Official-style README for a TRON Support Center — technical support, security guidance, and developer resources.

---

## Overview

TRON Support Center provides users and developers with clear guidance for managing TRON network assets (TRX, TRC-20, TRC-721), resolving common transaction issues, integrating wallets and APIs, and maintaining security best practices.

This repository/document is intended for support teams, developer integrators, and users looking for step-by-step troubleshooting and reference materials.

---

## Key Features

* Wallet & account assistance (mnemonic, private key safety)
* Transaction troubleshooting (pending tx, bandwidth/energy, failed transfers)
* Smart contract support (TRC-20 / TRC-721 interactions)
* Developer guides and API/SDK examples
* Security best practices and anti-phishing guidance
* Contact channels and escalation workflow

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* A TRON-compatible wallet (e.g., TronLink, TronWallet)
* Node / RPC access for advanced diagnostics (public or self-hosted)
* Basic familiarity with transactions and gas model (Bandwidth / Energy)

### Common Commands (curl examples)

**Get account info (HTTP RPC)**

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"wallet/getaccount","params":["<ADDRESS_HEX>"],"id":1}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://<TRON_NODE_RPC>
```

**Get transaction by ID**

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"wallet/gettransactionbyid","params":["<TXID>"] ,"id":1}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://<TRON_NODE_RPC>
```

> Replace `<TRON_NODE_RPC>`, `<ADDRESS_HEX>`, and `<TXID>` with your node URL, account, and transaction ID.

## Troubleshooting

### Transaction stuck / pending

1. Verify transaction hash on a TRON block explorer.
2. Check account bandwidth and energy — low bandwidth can delay simple transfers.
3. If using a third-party custodian or exchange, confirm they processed the outbound transaction.
4. For contract interactions, ensure sufficient energy or use `tronweb` to estimate energy.

### Wrong token / token not received

* Confirm token contract address (TRC-20) and decimals.
* Check the `to` address and token transfer logs in the transaction receipt.
* If tokens were sent to a smart contract address, recovery may require contract owner cooperation.

### Failed contract call

* Inspect revert message in transaction receipt (if available).
* Reproduce call locally with the same input and read-only `triggerConstantContract` to debug.

---

## Developer Guides

### SDKs & Tools

* TronWeb (JavaScript) — common actions: create account, sign tx, sendRawTransaction
* TronGrid / public RPC providers — quick access for development

**Basic sign+send flow (pseudo-code)**

```js
const tx = await tronWeb.transactionBuilder.sendTrx(to, amount, from);
const signed = await tronWeb.trx.sign(tx, privateKey);
const result = await tronWeb.trx.sendRawTransaction(signed);
```

## Security & Best Practices

* Never share your private key or full mnemonic with support staff.
* Only accept official links and verify domain names before entering secrets.
* Enable hardware wallets for high-value holdings when supported.
* Keep software and node clients updated to latest stable releases.

---

## Escalation & Support Workflow

1. User opens support ticket with: account address (public), tx hash (if applicable), timestamp, and screenshots (if available).
2. Support triage: reproduce issue, query node, and check mempool/confirmations.
3. If recovery or coordination with 3rd party (exchange/custodian) is needed, escalate to the operations team and log all communications.
4. Provide timeframe and next steps to user; do not request private keys or mnemonics.
